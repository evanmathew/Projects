- ## Machine Learning
    - [Heart Failure Analysis & Prediction Using Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/evanmathew/Projects/tree/main/Machine%20Learning%20Model/Heart%20Failure%20Analysis%20%26%20Prediction%20Using%20Logistic%20Regression%20Model): I leveraged my data analysis and machine learning skills to conduct a comprehensive study on heart failure prediction using logistic regression. Heart failure is a critical health concern, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. By applying data science techniques to a large dataset of patient records, I aimed to develop an accurate predictive model.

I collected data on several key aspects of sugarcane production, including total production, production per person in kilograms, the country with the highest production, and the yield of sugarcane in each country.

 - ## Web Scraping
    - [YouTube Data Scraping](https://github.com/evanmathew/Projects/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/YouTube%20Channel%20Data%20Scraping): I harnessed the power of web automation and data scraping techniques using Selenium to gather valuable insights and information from YouTube, one of the world's largest video-sharing platforms. By automating the data collection process, I was able to retrieve and analyze data on videos such as views, likes, date of publishing, and the video description.
    - [Scrapping Wikipedia content through Google search](https://github.com/evanmathew/Projects/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Wikepedia%20Data%20Scraping%20Using%20Google%20Search): The primary objective of this project is to develop a Python script that can scrape relevant Wikipedia content through Google search queries, and then showcase the scraped information on a LinkedIn profile. This project aims to demonstrate web scraping, data manipulation, and integration with LinkedIn using Python.
    - [Stock Image Data Scraping](https://github.com/evanmathew/Projects/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Stock%20Image%20Web%20Scraping): This project was just an exercise to gather information about images, including the number of likes, comments, image URLs, and unique image IDs, enabling more informed content selection and analysis
