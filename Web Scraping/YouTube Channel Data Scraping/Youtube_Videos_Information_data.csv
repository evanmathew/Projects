193,Bi-Wizard School Coding Contest | GeeksforGeeks School,1 year ago,2.5K views,Show chat replay,"Coding is the most in-demand and upcoming skill of the industry and it will continue to grow as the years pass. Despite all this, students often restrict themselves from getting started with coding, and not only students, but the parents are also not very much active in encouraging their wards to learn to code.  

And we believe now is the time to break this stigma around this conversation and to promote coding culture among students and create genuine interest & curiosity in them to get started with coding. Keeping this in mind, GeeksforGeeks is coming up with an exciting coding tournament exclusively for school students!
